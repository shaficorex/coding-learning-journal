# Coding Learning Journal

This repository documents my structured journey in mastering:

- C++ fundamentals
- STL
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Problem Solving Patterns
- Competitive Programming

## Purpose

I write everything in my own words to:
- Strengthen conceptual clarity
- Improve problem solving ability
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Track my growth over time

## Structure

01_CPP_Fundamentals → Core C++ concepts  
02_STL → Standard Template Library
